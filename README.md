# Swift Curriculum

Learning to write code in a new language by just jumping in is how I typically learn.
But learning on the go to build an app can leave some gaps in knowledge. 
With Swift there are so many features which are unique to the language which should
be explored and understood. This GitHub repository will be used to systematically
learn by writing code following a list of topics to cover. Books, blogs, articles
and official Swift documentation will be used to prepare the materials and to 
link back to the topics. The [Wiki] will be used to document the various topics
which are explored. Code will be prepared with Playgrounds or Xcode projects as
appropriate in order to explore a topic. More topics will be added as well. 
Swift is rapidly evolving and new techniques are emerging all the time.

* [Checklist]
* [Reading List]

### Blogging and Gists

Some topics will be covered by a blog to share the information. Code snippets which
can stand by themselve will be shared as Gists and linked from the blog and [Wiki].

### Contributing

I'd like to know if I have missed a topic. I am sure this list is not complete.
There are many features in Swift which can easily be overlooked when building an
app. And it is possible not use many features which could otherwise by very helpful
just for the sake of building the app instead of endlessly applying new ideas. Over
time more of the Swift feature set could be incorporated into app development.

While the [Swift Language Guide] can provide a good overview there are many ideas
which come from outside official channels. One example is [Swift: Selector syntax sugar]
which was [shared on Twitter](https://twitter.com/clattner_llvm/status/712678968697032705) 
by Chris Lattner. A collection of these great ideas will be added to the [Reading List].
Many of these blog posts and articles will come from [iOS Dev Weekly] which has been a
great resource for surfacing great innovations from the developer community.

If you would like to suggest topics, learning material or to change existing material, 
please either using [Issues] or fork this repository and send a Pull Request with your 
changes.
