# Swift Curriculum

Learning to write code in a new langauge just jumping in is how I typically learn.
But there is also value in making sure that every aspect of the langauge is covered.
With Swift there are so many features which are unique to the language which should
be explored and understood. This GitHub repository will be used to systematically
learn by writing code following a list of topics to cover. Books, blogs, articles
and official Swift documentation will be used to prepare the materials and to 
link back to the topics. The [Wiki] will be used to document the various topics
which are explorted. More topics will be added we well. Swift is rapidly evolving
and new techniques are emerging all the time.
